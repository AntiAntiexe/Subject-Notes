# Subject Notes
These notes are all hand crafted by 4 high school students. All subjects have had great consideration when completing the work. It includes Math (the goal is for year 10 and up), physics, chemistry and programming (only python at the moment). All these have been created based on the Victorian curriculum, using resources such as textbooks and educational videos.
